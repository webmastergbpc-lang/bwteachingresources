# Contributing to R2-Manager-Worker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to R2-Manager-Worker! This guide covers everything you need to get started — from setting up your environment to understanding our code conventions and submitting a pull request.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24+** (LTS) — required by `engines` in `package.json`
- **Git** with SSH access configured
- **Cloudflare Account** (Free tier works!) with `npx wrangler login` authenticated
- **Docker** (optional, for container-based testing)

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/R2-Manager-Worker.git
   cd R2-Manager-Worker
   ```

3. **Install** dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
   ```

   Edit both files with your settings. The `.env.development` file is automatically loaded by Vite when running `npm run dev` and automatically points to the local worker on port 8787. No manual switching between dev and production URLs required.

5. **Build** the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Run the quality gate** to confirm everything works:

   ```bash
   npm run check   # Runs ESLint + TypeScript strict-mode type checking
   ```

7. **Create a branch** for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

| Script              | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Start frontend Vite dev server on port 5173          |
| `npm run build`     | Build React app and typescript worker                |
| `npm run check`     | **Quality gate** — lint + typecheck (run before PRs) |
| `npm run lint`      | ESLint only                                          |
| `npm run lint:fix`  | ESLint with auto-fix                                 |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript strict-mode type checking                 |

### Running the App Locally (Two Terminal Windows Required)

We use Vite for the frontend and Wrangler for the backend API.

**Terminal 1: Frontend dev server (Vite)**

```bash
npm run dev
# Opens http://localhost:5173
```

**Terminal 2: Worker dev server (Wrangler)**

```bash
npx wrangler dev --config wrangler.dev.toml --local
# Opens http://localhost:8787
```

> **Note:** The local database mock operations return simulated success responses for UI testing. Files and folders are not actually stored. Local development is for UI/UX testing only. Authentication, rate-limiting, and CORS are automatically bypassed. For full functionality, deploy to Cloudflare Workers.

## Project Architecture

```

├── app.tsx              # Main UI component
├── filegrid.tsx         # File browser with grid/list views
└── services/            # API client and auth utilities
worker/                   # Backend API (Cloudflare Workers)
├── index.ts             # Worker runtime & API endpoints
├── routes/              # API route handlers
└── utils/               # Helper utilities

.env.example             # Environment variables template
```

## Code Conventions

### File Naming

All files and directories use **kebab-case** (lowercase with dashes):

- ✅ `file-grid.tsx`, `api-service.ts`, `job-history/`
- ❌ `FileGrid.tsx`, `apiService.ts`

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** with no `any` types — the entire codebase is fully type-safe.
- **No `eslint-disable`** — do not suppress linting rules to evade established type or formatting standards. Exceptions are allowed ONLY when necessary to deal with deprecations external to our code (e.g., SDK backward compatibility) or cases where the linter genuinely misunderstands intent (e.g., explicitly matching control characters like in `no-control-regex` exceptions).
- **Formatting** is handled automatically by Prettier during the release workflow via `/bump-deploy` — no need to run it manually.

### Modularity

- **Source files stay under ~500 lines.** If a file is approaching that limit, split it proactively.
- **Split pattern:** `foo.ts` → `foo/` directory with sub-modules + `foo/index.ts` barrel re-export.
- **Group by functional cohesion** (e.g., CRUD vs. analysis, basic vs. advanced), not arbitrary line counts.

### CSS Styleguide

- Use CSS modules or scoped styles when possible
- Use meaningful class names (BEM notation recommended)
- Mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Use CSS custom properties for colors and spacing

## Error Handling & Logging

Use the centralized logger with structured payloads. Include: `module`, `operation`, `entityId`, `context`, and `stack` (for errors). Severity levels: `error`, `warning`, `info`.

Example structured error pattern for APIs:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Descriptive message with context",
  "code": "R2_UPLOAD_FAILED"
}
```

## Changelog

Log all changes in **[`UNRELEASED.md`](UNRELEASED.md)** at the project root using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. Use the appropriate header:

- `### Added` — new features or tools
- `### Changed` — changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` — bug fixes
- `### Removed` — removed features
- `### Security` — vulnerability fixes

> **Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly** — it is assembled automatically during the release process.

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider using conventional commits:
  - `feat:` - A new feature
  - `fix:` - A bug fix
  - `docs:` - Documentation changes
  - `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor:` - Code refactoring without feature changes
  - `perf:` - Performance improvements
  - `test:` - Adding or updating tests
  - `chore:` - Build process, dependencies, or tooling

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Ensure all checks pass:**

   ```bash
   npm run check   # Lint + typecheck
   ```

2. **Update documentation** — if your change affects user-facing behavior, update the README, help resources, or Wiki as appropriate
3. **Update `UNRELEASED.md`** with your change
4. **Commit** with a clear, descriptive message in conventional commit format. Reference issues when applicable (`Fixes #123`). Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit.
5. **Push** to your fork and **open a Pull Request**

### What CI Will Check

When you open a PR, the following checks run automatically:

| Workflow           | What It Does                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Lint & Compile** | ESLint, TypeScript strict-mode, Vite Build   |
| **CodeQL**         | Static analysis for security vulnerabilities |
| **Docker Scout**   | Container image vulnerability checks         |

All checks must pass before merge. Security steps **hard-fail on fixable issues** — this is intentional.

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not** open a public issue. Please follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) and report it to **admin@adamic.tech**.

When contributing code, follow these security practices:

- **No secrets in code** — use environment variables (`.env` files are gitignored) or Cloudflare Secrets mapping.
- **Typed error classes** with descriptive messages — don't expose internal details like server stack traces to end users over the frontend.

## Questions?

If you have questions or want to discuss a potential contribution, feel free to:
