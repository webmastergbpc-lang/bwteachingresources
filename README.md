## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (Free tier works!)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24+ (LTS) and npm
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) (4.36.0+ for rate limiting)
- Domain managed by Cloudflare (optional - can use Workers.dev subdomain)

**Note:** Rate limiting requires a Cloudflare Workers paid plan. All other features work on the free tier.

### Installation

1. **Clone and install:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker.git
   cd R2-Manager-Worker
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
   ```

   Edit both files with your settings.

   **Optional - Enable Rate Limiting:**
   - Rate limiting is pre-configured in `wrangler.toml.example`
   - Requires Wrangler 4.36.0+ and Workers paid plan
   - If you don't have a paid plan, the app works fine without it

3. **Create R2 bucket:**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create your-bucket-name
   ```

4. **Configure Cloudflare Access:**
   - Set up GitHub OAuth in [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/)
   - Create an Access application for your domain
   - Copy the Application Audience (AUD) Tag

5. **Set Worker secrets:**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put ACCOUNT_ID
   npx wrangler secret put CF_EMAIL
   npx wrangler secret put API_KEY
   npx wrangler secret put TEAM_DOMAIN
   npx wrangler secret put POLICY_AUD
   ```

6. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

**📖 For detailed instructions, see the [Installation & Setup Guide](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Installation-&-Setup).**

---

### Upgrading from v3.1.0

If you already have Job History set up and want to enable individual action logging (file uploads, downloads, deletes, etc.), run the schema migration to add the new `audit_log` table:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute r2-manager-metadata --remote --file=worker/schema.sql
```

> **Note:** This command is safe to run multiple times - it uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so existing tables are not affected. If you don't run the migration, the application will continue to work normally but individual actions won't be logged (only bulk operations).

**📖 See the [Job History Guide](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Job-History) for complete documentation.**

---

## 🐳 Docker Development Environment

For local development and testing, use the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull writenotenow/r2-bucket-manager:latest
```

```bash
docker run -p 8787:8787 writenotenow/r2-bucket-manager:latest
```

Access the development server at `http://localhost:8787`

**Note:** Docker deployment is for development/testing only. For production, deploy to Cloudflare Workers using the instructions above.

**📖 See the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/writenotenow/r2-bucket-manager) for complete Docker documentation.**

## 📦 Bulk Operations

### Multi-Bucket Download

Download multiple buckets simultaneously as a single, timestamped ZIP archive.

- **Zero Dependencies:** Generates archives on the fly without size limits.
- **Smart Structure:** Maintains full folder hierarchy (`/bucket-name/folder/file.ext`).
- **Bulk Actions:** dedicated toolbar for "Select All" and batch processing.

### Bulk Bucket Deletion

Select and force-delete multiple buckets in one operation.

- **Safety First:** Enhanced confirmation modal calculates total files and size before deletion.
- **Force Delete:** Automatically recursively empties buckets before removing them.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual feedback for long-running deletion tasks.

---

## 🔎 Search & Filtering

### Cross-Bucket Search

Real-time, server-side parallel search across **all** your buckets instantly.

- **Performance:** Queries thousands of files in seconds with minimal overhead.
- **Direct Actions:** Move, copy, download, or delete files directly from search results.
- **Deep Linking:** Click bucket badges to navigate directly to the source.

### Advanced Filtering

Comprehensive client-side filtering for large buckets.

- **Smart Filters:** Filter by **File Type** (Images, Code, Docs), **Size** (Presets or custom ranges), and **Date** (Upload time).
- **Context Aware:** Toggle between "Files Only," "Folders Only," or "All."
- **Persistent:** Active filters remain applied during batch operations and navigation.

## 📋 Job History & Audit Logging

Track all operations with a comprehensive audit trail and event timeline.

### Features

- **Bulk Operation Tracking**: Automatically track bulk downloads, uploads, deletions, moves, and copies
- **Individual Action Logging**: Every file upload, download, delete, rename, move, and copy is logged
- **Folder & Bucket Auditing**: Track folder creation, deletion, renaming, and all bucket operations
- **Filterable List**: Filter by status (success, failed, running), operation type, bucket, and date range
- **Grouped Operations**: Operation types organized by category (Bulk, File, Folder, Bucket, AI)
- **Event Timeline**: View detailed progress history for bulk jobs in a modal dialog
- **Real-time Progress**: See percentage completion and item counts during bulk operations
- **Job Search**: Quickly find jobs by ID
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by date, item count, or error count

### Configuration

Job history requires a D1 database. Add the binding to your `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "METADATA"
database_name = "r2-manager-metadata"
database_id = "your-database-id"
```

Create the database and run the schema:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create r2-manager-metadata
npx wrangler d1 execute r2-manager-metadata --remote --file=worker/schema.sql
```

## 🤖 AI Search Integration

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting

Intelligent, per-user rate limiting prevents abuse while ensuring fair resource access. Limits are applied based on the authenticated user's email.

| Tier       | Operations                | Limit   | Period | Scope               |
| :--------- | :------------------------ | :------ | :----- | :------------------ |
| **READ**   | List, Search, Signed URLs | 600 req | 60s    | High-volume access  |
| **WRITE**  | Upload, Rename, Move      | 200 req | 60s    | Modification safety |
| **DELETE** | Remove Files/Buckets      | 60 req  | 60s    | Destructive actions |

**Note:** Rate limiting returns standard `429 Too Many Requests` headers and can be configured or disabled via `wrangler.toml`.

### Response Headers

When rate limited, responses include:

- `Retry-After` - Seconds to wait before retrying
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` - Maximum requests allowed in the period
- `X-RateLimit-Period` - Time period in seconds
- `X-RateLimit-Tier` - Which tier was exceeded (READ/WRITE/DELETE)

### Configuration

Rate limits are defined in `wrangler.toml` using Cloudflare Workers Rate Limiting API bindings. To modify limits, edit the configuration and redeploy:

```toml
[[ratelimits]]
name = "RATE_LIMITER_READ"
namespace_id = "1001"
simple = { limit = 600, period = 60 }
```

**Requirements:**

- Wrangler CLI version 4.36.0 or later
- Cloudflare Workers paid plan (rate limiting not available on free plan)

**Note:** Rate limiting is optional. If not configured in `wrangler.toml`, the application will function normally without rate limiting protection.

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Quick Start (Two Terminal Windows Required)

**Terminal 1: Frontend dev server (Vite)**

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Runs on: `http://localhost:5173`
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled
- Watches for file changes automatically

**Terminal 2: Worker dev server (Wrangler)**

```bash
npx wrangler dev --config wrangler.dev.toml --local
```

- Runs on: `http://localhost:8787`
- Uses local bindings with mock data (no secrets required)
- Automatically reloads on code changes
- **Note:** Returns mock bucket data for testing UI without Cloudflare API access

### Access the Application

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` - the frontend will automatically communicate with the Worker API on port 8787.

**Note:** Authentication and rate limiting are disabled on localhost for easier development. No Cloudflare Access configuration needed for local dev.

### Development Configuration Files

- `.env.development` - **Auto-loaded by Vite in dev mode** (sets `VITE_WORKER_API=http://localhost:8787`)
- `.env` - Base environment variables (optional overrides)
- `wrangler.dev.toml` - Development-specific Worker config (skips frontend build, adds mock data support)
- `wrangler.toml` - Production Worker config (includes build step)

> **Note:** The `.env.development` file is automatically loaded by Vite when running `npm run dev`. No manual switching between dev and production URLs required.

### What's Different in Local Development

- **Authentication:** Automatically disabled for localhost requests
- **Rate Limiting:** Automatically bypassed for localhost requests
- **CORS:** Configured to allow `http://localhost:5173` with credentials
- **Mock Data:** Returns simulated responses (no real Cloudflare API calls)
- **No Secrets Required:** Works without `ACCOUNT_ID`, `CF_EMAIL`, or `API_KEY`

### Mock Operations in Local Development

The following operations return simulated success responses for UI testing:

- ✅ List buckets (returns `dev-bucket`)
- ✅ Create bucket
- ✅ Rename bucket
- ✅ List files (returns empty array)
- ✅ Upload files (simulates success, files not stored)
- ✅ Create folders

**Note:** Files and folders are not actually stored. Local development is for UI/UX testing only. For full functionality, deploy to Cloudflare Workers.

## 🙈 Hiding Buckets from the UI

You can configure R2 Bucket Manager to hide specific buckets from the UI (e.g., system buckets, internal buckets, or buckets managed by other applications).

### How to Hide Buckets

1. **Edit `worker/index.ts`:**
   - Locate the `systemBuckets` array (around line 373)
   - Add your bucket name(s) to the array

```typescript
const systemBuckets = [
  "r2-bucket",
  "sqlite-mcp-server-wiki",
  "your-bucket-name",
];
```

2. **Deploy the changes:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

### Example

To hide buckets named `blog-wiki` and `internal-data`:

```typescript
const systemBuckets = [
  "r2-bucket",
  "sqlite-mcp-server-wiki",
  "blog-wiki",
  "internal-data",
];
```

**Note:** Hidden buckets are completely filtered from the API response and won't appear in the bucket list or be accessible through the UI.

**📖 See the [Configuration Reference](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Configuration-Reference#hiding-buckets) for more details.**

## 📝 Extending File Type Support

To add support for new file extensions:

1. **Update `src/services/api.ts`:**
   - Add file type category to `FILE_TYPES` object
   - Map extensions in `getConfigByExtension()`

2. **Update `src/filegrid.tsx`:**
   - Add custom icon rendering for new extensions

3. **Update `src/app.tsx`:**
   - Add file type to upload instructions

**📖 See the [Development Guide](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Development-Guide#adding-file-type-support) for complete instructions.**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Authentication errors:** Verify `TEAM_DOMAIN` and `POLICY_AUD` secrets
- **Bucket not found:** Check `wrangler.toml` bucket name matches exactly
- **Upload failures:** Verify your Cloudflare plan's upload size limits
- **Deployment issues:** Re-authenticate with `npx wrangler login`

**📖 For detailed solutions, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Troubleshooting).**
